# text-to-banger
![Metatag Image](webapp/public/metatag.png)

A simple API converting a user's proposed tweet into a veritable banger.

## To run the app locally
### Clone the repo

```
gh repo clone effectiveaccelerationism/text-to-banger
```

### Install and run script
```
sudo chmod+x install.sh && chmod+x start.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
Insert your API key in window and press CTRL+O to save and CTRL+x to close and continue installation
```
./start.sh
```



### Install and run the app manually
```
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```
The app will be running on http://localhost:3000

### Run the OpenAI api server
Currently the app runs with an OpenAI API server, soon to be dismissed in favor of a custom finetuned model. To run the OpenAI API server, you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once you have your API key, create a file named `.env` in the `api` directory and add the following line to it:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=text-davinci-003
```
It's advisable to finetune a model by running the `generate_finetuned_model.py` script in the `model` directory.

Then, run the server with
```
cd api
python -m venv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
source env/bin/activate # on Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
python server.py
```

NOTE: You must have both the webapp and the apiserver running in two separate terminal instances to use the app.
